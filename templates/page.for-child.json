It’s exactly what’s meant to happen.</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">Youth goalkeepers are still learning technique — which means they often land palms-first, drag gloves on turf, or push off using the latex instead of their fists.</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">It’s part of the process. It’s how they figure things out.</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">That’s why we use Giga latex on all our junior gloves.</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">It gives them solid grip, but holds up far better than the soft pro-grade latex we use on adult models.</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">Our gloves aren’t built to stay perfect.<br>They’re built to take the hits, session after session.</p>",
