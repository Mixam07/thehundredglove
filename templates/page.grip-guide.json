But here’s how the performance differs:</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">Our highest-grade latex. Sticky, soft, and match-ready from the first touch. This is the stuff serious keepers wear when it matters most. It gives you that pro-level grip — but it demands proper care. You train in this every day? It won’t last long.</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">Best for: Match day, elite performance, clean conditions.</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">On our junior gloves, we use Giga latex — slightly firmer and far more durable. Still great grip, but built to handle the way younger keepers dive, push off, and drag their hands. It’s designed to take hits while they learn their craft.</p>\n<p class=\"section-content__text\">Best for: Youth players, artificial pitches, training environments.</p>",

It removes residue and “activates” the latex.</li>\n<li class=\"section-content__elem\">Keep the palms damp when playing<br>Latex grips better when it’s slightly moist. Dry latex drags and wears faster.</li>\n<li class=\"section-content__elem\">Rinse after every session<br>Cold or lukewarm water only. No soap. Just clear the dirt and sweat.</li>\n<li class=\"section-content__elem\">Dry flat, out of sunlight<br>No heaters. No tumble dryers. No radiators. Latex hates heat.</li>\n<li class=\"section-content__elem\">Store them properly<br>Flat. Palms together. In a glove wallet or breathable pouch. Not stuffed into the bottom of your kit bag.</li>\n<li class=\"section-content__elem\">Use separate gloves for training and match day<br>This one’s non-negotiable. Don’t kill your best latex by dragging it through Monday night sessions.</li>\n</ol>",
